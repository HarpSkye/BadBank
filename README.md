# Technology Used:
### HTML, CSS, Javascript, Boostrap, React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Cors

# Features: 
### Instead of building a static Spa (single page application), this is a fully functional and dynamic webpage using express and node to communicate back and forth with the context that was slected at the navigation bar. The single User Content is generated and saved in MongoDB, which makes the information retrieveable and updateable based on the changes from front-end.
